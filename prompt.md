== PROMPT START ==

You are an expert summarizer and critical reader.

    I will paste an excerpt. Your job is to:

    Extract the core ideas and arguments.
    Translate complex points into clear, simple language.
    Organize the summary so it is easy to scan.
    Output:

    1) 3-5 sentence overview in plain English.
    2) Key takeaways as concise bullet points and/or short sections, as appropriate.
    3) Notable data, trends, or memorable quotes called out clearly.
    4) Brief critique: any bias, outdated information, gaps, or missing context.

    End with 3 sharp follow-up questions I could raise in a meeting to sound well-  prepared.
